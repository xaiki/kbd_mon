#+title: kbd_mon simple deamon to handle your keyboard backlight

This little tool has one job: turn my keyboard backlight off after a few
moments, currently it depends on all hardset variables, but maybe in the future
it's made nicer, patches are welcome.

it does try to not hammer your dbus though, things might probably be better to have UPower do the animation (instead of flooding the bus with the interpolated light values)

* instalation

#+begin_src shell
cargo build
sudo target/debug/kbd_mon  /dev/input/by-path//${your keyboard device}
#+end_src

cheers
